# BLU07 - Feature Extraction

## What is in this BLU?

This is the first big learning unit of the text classification specialization. It will introduce you to common tools used when dealing with natural language processing problems.

We will focus on how to extract and process features from raw text. The objective is to prepare you for the hackathon, so you can see the exercises as a small scale version of the processing you might do in the hackathon. 

If you are able to solve this BLU, you should be familiar with several basic techniques of text processing and feature extraction :)

## How to use this repo

As in the previous BLUs, go through the Learning Notebooks (they are in the Learning Notebooks folder),
 then do the Exercise notebook, and submit it on the portal.

## "I need help understanding something"

You can and should ask for help, be it about Learning Notebooks, Exercises, or anything else. Please checkout the How to Ask for Help, and remember not to share code when asking for help about the exercises!
